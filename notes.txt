TODO DEV
  pubSub:
    holding off on adding audio.play() to pubsub... - how will 'silent' root note change affect things?
    maybe build that feature soon...

Hmmm.
  seems like there was some thought that the whole left/right hand listeners might be refactored...

TODO DEV MOAR
  z vs ctrl-z problem... does keypress.js accommodate this? build my own library for this perhaps...

    "is_solitary" - may be slowing things down because you can't trigger a key if another is still held.
    let's fork keypress! & add an 'excludes' option

TODO
  - add synth options
  - add gain options


how to:
  keyup & keydown
    will need a "down" handler as usual




expressive split qwerty
!yes! - think ("vim-style") where a current pitch is moved around by interval, rather than playing a specific note :
(Enter) option to trigger & hold note
(Tab) toggles Mode where the base pitch stays fixed (on spacebar)
off-hand controls
can port a mento be adjusted while a note is held?

mode shifting:
  trigger modes:
    triggerAttackRelease
    triggerAttack/triggerRelease
    note sustain - space to turn on/off
  pitch selection:
    moving root
    fixed root (in note sustain mode: space returns to root note, any same pitch toggles on/off on second press)
      do you want to have note sustain mode in fixed root mode at all...

"shift" modifier - moves root pitch without triggering note (in any mode)


sculpt hand hmm: param editing vs key-responsive sound manipulation?

tab/enter/etc. to toggle 'boards'

hmm:
  may want a modifiable "reset" quick fix in case you get lost.
    (eg: ctrl-x sets note to C3)


parking lot:
  make-your own presets
