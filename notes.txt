TODO
  current dev plan is to follow along with these tuts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABs-wDaaxChu82q_xQgUb4f
    goal is to get this to a pub/sub pattern so that views and audio auto-update on their relevant state changes
    ... but who's got time for that???

how to:
  keyup & keydown
    will need a "down" handler as usual

mode shifting:
  trigger modes:
    triggerAttackRelease
    triggerAttack/triggerRelease
    note sustain - space to turn on/off
  pitch selection:
    moving root
    fixed root (in note sustain mode: space returns to root note, any same pitch toggles on/off on second press)
      do you want to have note sustain mode in fixed root mode at all...

"shift" modifier - moves root pitch without triggering note (in any mode)


sculpt hand: param editing vs key-responsive sound manipulation

PARAM TREE:
  basic
    gain portamento detune
  synth type
    saw sin tri etc...
  envelope
    adsr
  effects
    filter
    delay
      delay on/off delay time delay feed
    tremolo
    vibrato
    chorus
    phaser
  presets
    1 2 3 4 5



hmm:
  may want a modifiable "reset" quick fix in case you get lost.
    (eg: ctrl-x sets note to C3)


parking lot:
  make-your own presets
