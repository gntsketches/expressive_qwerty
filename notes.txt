TODO
  set up observer pattern for view

  double-synth: 'current note' functionality - b & y, could add other keys maybe too

how to:
  keyup & keydown
    will need a "down" handler as usual
  specifying 'left' or 'right' for each listener function is a lot of typing...

mode shifting:
  trigger modes:
    triggerAttackRelease
    triggerAttack/triggerRelease
    note sustain - space to turn on/off
  pitch selection:
    moving root
    fixed root (in note sustain mode: space returns to root note, any same pitch toggles on/off on second press)
      do you want to have note sustain mode in fixed root mode at all...

"shift" modifier - moves root pitch without triggering note (in any mode)

SOUND PARAMS:
  gain
  portamento
  synth type
  a
  d
  s
  r
  vibrato depth
  vibrato rate
  delay on/off
  delay time
  delay feed

  Advanced:
    filter





hmm:
  may want a modifiable "reset" quick fix in case you get lost.
    (eg: ctrl-x sets note to C3)
